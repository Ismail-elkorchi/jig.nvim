*jig-safety*  jig.nvim safety model

SAFETY MODEL
  - explicit operations over implicit automation
  - deny-by-default for startup non-essential network actions
  - optional modules are removable and profile-scoped
  - policy decisions are attributable and logged where applicable

SAFE PROFILE
  NVIM_APPNAME=jig-safe
    - keeps core + help/docs commands
    - excludes optional UI/nav/completion/lsp/tools/agent layers

RISK SURFACES
  - startup network operations
  - local config execution (`exrc`, `modeline`)
  - shell execution
  - MCP trust and capability boundaries

OPERATIONAL COMMANDS
  :JigHealth
  :JigToolHealth
  :JigMcpTrust
  :JigRepro

NOT GUARANTEED / BOUNDARIES
  - Safety controls are guardrails, not proof of total protection.
  - Deny/ask policy quality depends on configured rules and user decisions.
  - External tools can fail independently of editor core state.
