*jig-tools*  Jig Tools and Terminal Integration

OVERVIEW
  WP-08 provides deterministic external command execution and terminal UX.

COMMANDS
  :JigExec {cmd...}
      Run a non-interactive command through Jig's wrapper and display
      stdout/stderr, exit code, duration, cwd, and failure classification.

  :JigToolHealth
      Show shell/tool/provider status and execution policy summary.

  :JigTerm [root|buffer]
      Open interactive terminal in Jig root (default) or current buffer dir.

EXECUTION RULES
  - argv-first execution via vim.system()
  - no implicit shell=true
  - sync waits always use explicit timeout
  - missing binaries/providers are non-fatal and actionable

FAILURE CLASSIFICATION
  - spawn_error
  - timeout
  - system_wait_nil
  - system_wait_error
  - exit_nonzero

SAFE PROFILE
  NVIM_APPNAME=jig-safe disables tool and terminal commands.

POLICY
  Jig does not auto-install tools.
  Jig does not auto-run startup network actions.

CHECKS
  :checkhealth jig
