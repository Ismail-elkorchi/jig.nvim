*jig-security*  Jig Security and Trust Boundaries (WP-10)

OVERVIEW
  WP-10 adds operational security controls for:
    - startup network policy (deny-by-default for non-essential network actions)
    - local config execution risk visibility (`exrc`, `secure`, `modeline`)
    - MCP trust registry and capability enforcement
    - destructive execution safety with explicit user-only override

STARTUP NETWORK POLICY
  Optional startup tracing hooks:
    JIG_TRACE_STARTUP_NET=1
    JIG_STRICT_STARTUP_NET=1

  strict mode blocks startup network-ish commands and records traces.
  trace file:
    stdpath('state')/jig/security/startup-net-trace.jsonl
  override path:
    JIG_STARTUP_NET_TRACE_PATH

LOCAL CONFIG SURFACES
  Relevant help topics:
    :h 'exrc'
    :h 'secure'
    :h 'modeline'

  Jig health reports current values and remediation guidance.

MCP TRUST
  Commands:
    :JigMcpTrust
    :JigMcpTrust allow <server>
    :JigMcpTrust ask <server>
    :JigMcpTrust deny <server>
    :JigMcpTrust revoke <server>

  Project MCP configs are untrusted by default.
  Trust decisions are explicit, revocable, and logged.

EXEC SAFETY
  :JigExec blocks destructive commands by default.
  user-only override:
    :JigExec! <cmd ...>

  Overrides are visible in output and logged.
  Non-user actors cannot use destructive override.

SAFE PROFILE
  NVIM_APPNAME=jig-safe does not load optional security/agent command surfaces.
