*jig-release*  Jig release operations

OVERVIEW
  Release operations are explicit and deterministic.
  No startup-time install, update, or network mutation is introduced by release policy.

CHANNELS
  stable
      release-tag oriented publication (`vX.Y.Z`).

  edge
      branch-tracking publication on `main`.

  Channel metadata command:
    :JigChannel [stable|edge]
  Persisted at:
    ${stdpath("state")}/jig/channel.json

RELEASE CHECKLIST
  1. Required CI lanes pass:
     - stable + previous stable matrix in required job
  2. Local deterministic verification:
     - `nvim --headless -u NONE -l tests/run_harness.lua -- --all`
     - `tests/ops/run_harness.sh`
     - `tests/perf/run_harness.sh`
  3. Docs sync and helptags:
     - `nvim --headless -u NONE -l tests/docs/update_helptags.lua`
     - `git diff --exit-code -- doc/tags`
  4. Tag publication:
     - `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "jig.nvim vX.Y.Z"`
     - `git push origin vX.Y.Z`

NOT GUARANTEED / BOUNDARIES
  - Release checklist reduces regression risk; it does not eliminate all environment-specific failures.
  - Hosted CI cannot represent every terminal/font/shell variant.
